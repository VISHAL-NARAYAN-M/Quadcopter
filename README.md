# Quadcopter
This project involves building a manually operated quadcopter powered by the Pixhawk 4.8 flight controller. The drone is controlled via a traditional RC transmitter and receiver, with flight stabilization handled by the Pixhawk. It serves as a foundational project for understanding drone assembly, wiring, calibration, and manual flight control.
